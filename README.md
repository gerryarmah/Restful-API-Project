In this project, an attempt is made to set up a RESTful API using the Node.js application Express framework. 
The API fetches data from a JSON file and exposes it via different endpoints so that the data becomes easy to interact with.

Objectives
Create a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.
How to handle JSON data efficiently in a backend application.
Main HTTP methods implementation for data management: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
Learning how to set up and configure an Express application in Node.js to dynamically read and write JSON data, designing RESTful APIs with well-defined routes and endpoints.
This allowed me to learn the basics of backend development using Node.js and Express. 
It improved my knowledge related to the design of RESTful APIs. 
I've also learned how to handle JSON data and some of the main HTTP methods that really helped me understand how data flow between the server and client is handled.
That was rather hard, but at least it gave me a good base for future web development projects.
